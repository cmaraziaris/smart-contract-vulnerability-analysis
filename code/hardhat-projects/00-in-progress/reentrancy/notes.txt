Notes:

* ERC20_token.sol *

// Re-entrancy
(bool sent, ) = _recipient.call{value : eth_burnt}("");
require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
// tokenBalance[_recipient] -= _amount;
// tokenTotalSupply -= _amount;

Didn't work, it just reverted the whole transaction when underflow happened, (sol >= 0.8.0)
so I had to add the `unchecked` option, which is a bit dumb, 
not sure if this could happen in an *actual* token written in sol >= 0.8.0
